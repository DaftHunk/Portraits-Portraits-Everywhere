WHAT IS IT?:
-----------------------------------------------------
Portraits Portraits Everywhere (PPE) - core component
-----------------------------------------------------
The core component of this mod adds portraits to speaking NPCs in the Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine games.  It can be 
installed on multiple platforms including Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET), Baldur's Gate 1 Enhanced Edition including Siege 
of Dragonspear, Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition, and Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition.  The mod can add representative portraits 
for all 4617 speaking creatures throughout these games so that when you speak to them, these NPC characters that inhabit these 
rich worlds will appear a little bit more alive.

If any of the portraits are not to your satisfaction due to quality or you feel that the portrait does not
match the in game NPC, feel free to post on the forums for potential inclusion in future updates.  If there is a future patch to 
the game, it's a good idea to reinstall this mod.  Keep in mind that when installing or reinstalling this mod, NPCs on areas 
you've previously visited won't get portraits, but areas and NPCs you have not yet visited will get portraits.

If you start a new game, then all NPCs that should get portraits will get them.

-----------------------------------------------------
Category Portraits (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------
This mod has an optional Category Portraits component to assign portraits from a pool of random portraits to actors that are not 
assigned specific portraits by the main component. This component is highly recommended and covers beings that are genericly 
named. For example, human characters named "Thief" or "Mugger" will get portraits from the male or female Rogue pool, characters 
named "Commoner" or "Peasant" will get portraits from the commoners pool, and "Drow" will get portraits from either the male or 
female Drow pool. There are more than ninety pools of random portraits that range from a few portraits to over 20. There are more 
breakdowns for groups of Humans than there are for other races. Please note that you may get repetition in portraits if you speak 
to multiple characters as once a pool of portraits is exhausted, then an additional round of picks from the portrait pool will be 
assigned to additional NPCs.

There are two ways to install the Category Portraits component - Sequentially or Randomly. If you install the component 'Sequentially' 
then Portraits from the Pool are assigned in numerical order to allow for reproducible results. That means that when you speak to 
"Mugger" in the dark alley, he should look the same if you were to reinstall the mod. There is also a Random option to grab a random 
portrait from the pool so that our friend the "Mugger" might get a different portrait if this component was installed a second time. 
If the random option is selected then a random pick will be selected. The way the random picked works is that all possible numbers from 
a pool are used before a second pick of the same number is picked meaning that you should not get random picks out of a group of 5 with 
the same number being used until all 5 of the portraits have been picked. 

This is optimized for vanilla supported games but you might get some decent results for mod added characters. For example, if installed 
after other mods, then matches from those mods of characters specifically named "Mugger" would get portraits from the Rogue pool. Please 
note that how other mods name or code their creatures or whether they name their rogue characters specifically "Mugger" or one of the 
other matching keywords is beyond my control - results may vary. Due to the varying coding standards in mods and the vast number of 
potential mods available, there is little chance that this component will act perfectly for mod added NPCs but it will do the best that 
it is able to do. An example of where the component would not act perfectly is a a character for a mod that works for Baldur's Gate 1EE 
that describes a human as a Half Orc through dialogue. Mods made for Baldur's Gate 1 do not support Half Orcs because there were not a 
playable race and that character would appear human to the engine and would get a human portrait.

CREDITS and Additional Information
-----------------------------------------------------

This mod is based on older mods for Baldur's Gate prior to the EE editions had mods that included small portraits for some NPCs.   
The pictures in these mods are lower resolution than the ones carefully selected for this mod.  Some of these older mods for classic 
Baldur's Gate with smaller pictures that directly inspired this project are:
Gerri's BGT NPC Portraits ( https://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/downloads.php?id=69 )
BG1NPC ( http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg1npc/ )

Sources of the pictures include Neverwinter Nights portraits found online, searches for baldur's gate and IWD portraits, and as a last 
resort search engines were used to round out the collection.
 
If there are any particular portraits that need to be removed you don't wish them to be featured in this work, let me know and 
the pictures will be removed. If you have any suggestions for submissions or changes, please feel free to comment in the discussion 
forum.

If there are any copyright issues or this statement needs revision then please contact me to let me know what to do
